# Passengers need it, we have it.

This is a Python application designed to take names(input) from the passengers in airports, and search up the database and verbally communicate to them the location of their boarding gate, timing, and the relevant information. Extremely useful for forgetful passengers and reduces manpower needed for enquiry desks significantly since more than 70% of the queries are location based.

Libraries needed : 
1. SpeechRecognition as sr
2. gtts
